# Four in a Row - React Game

Four in a Row is a classic two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.

## Special Features

### Customizable Board Size
- **Dynamic Board Dimensions:** Players can customize the board size by choosing the width and height before starting the game, allowing for a unique and tailored gameplay experience each time.

### Play Against the PC
- **Computer Opponent:** If you're up for a challenge, you can opt to play against the PC. The computer "thinks" for three seconds, adding a realistic touch, before making a strategic move.

### Animated Token Fall
- **Visual Appeal:** Watch the tokens "fall" into place! The game animates the token drop, enhancing the visual feedback for the players as they watch their tokens slide into the game grid.

## This is it for now due to the time limitation. I will add more capabilities in the future :)
